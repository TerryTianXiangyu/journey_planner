    "# Robust Journey Planner\n",
    "This notebook describes the general path we have followed in order to convert raw data into a meaningful journey planner. The most important aspect of our developed planner is its robustness given that after exhaustive delay analysis based on historical data, every trip is associated with a probility. The system can be tested thanks to a validation method and the results can be visualied thanks to a curated interface. The purpose of this notebook is just to guide the reader in our learning and development process but there are links to more specific notebooks where all the details can be found. There are several parts to take into consideration:\n",
    "*   **[Initial Setup](#initial)** — import libraries and explain tools that will be used\n",
    "*   **[Public Transport Network](#network)**  — define network structure and connections timetable.\n",
    "*   **[Probabilistic Model](#probability)** — analyse delay for associating every connection with an uncertainty rsk.\n",
    "*   **[Route Planner Algorithm](#algorithm)**  — to apply a function to each element.\n",
    "*   **[User Interface](#interface)** — design interface with desired trip as input and connection alternatives as output\n",
    "*   **[Validation Method](#validation)** — test the developed system for checking its proper funtioning."

    "So after definiing the static nodes of our network (Zurich stations), we have to add the edges (the links) between each of them. Can we go from all possible stations to the rest of all possible stations? Is it worth it? How can we go? They are rather difficult questions to ask at first hand but it becomes easier after we perform some exploratory analysis on [SBB historical data](https://opentransportdata.swiss/en/dataset/istdaten) and we understand the difference between trip and connection: a **trip** makes reference to an ordered sequence of stops but they appear in different rows (one stop each) (having both arrival and departure times to/from this specific stop), where as a **connection** involves the departure time from one stop and the arrival time to a different one. Therefore, we conclude that connections are the edges of our network we are looking for, although the dataset is expressed in trips."
